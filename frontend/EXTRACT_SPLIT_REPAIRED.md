# ✅ Extract & Split Functions REPAIRED - Now Work Like All Other Apps

## 🐛 **Issue Reported**

"all work good..except (extract, split) repair this two functions to work real download like rest of applications"

## 🔍 **Root Cause Discovered**

Both ExtractPages and SplitPDF had a critical bug: they were referencing an **undefined variable** `selectedPages` in their download functions.

### **The Bug**

```typescript
// ❌ BROKEN CODE
const handleDownload = async () => {
  if (!uploadedFile || selectedPages.length === 0) return;
  //                    ↑ selectedPages was NEVER DEFINED!
```

This caused the downloads to fail silently because `selectedPages` was undefined, making `selectedPages.length` throw an error.

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Fixed ExtractPages** (`/tools/extract`)

**Before**: Undefined `selectedPages` variable

```typescript
// ❌ BROKEN
if (!uploadedFile || selectedPages.length === 0) {
```

**After**: Proper computation from state

```typescript
// ✅ FIXED
const selectedPages = pdfPages.filter((page) => page.selected);

if (!uploadedFile || selectedPages.length === 0) {
  toast({
    title: "No Pages Selected",
    description: "Please select pages to extract before downloading.",
    variant: "destructive",
  });
  return;
}
```

### **2. Fixed SplitPDF** (`/split-pdf`)

**Before**: Undefined `selectedPages` variable

```typescript
// ❌ BROKEN
if (!uploadedFile || selectedPages.length === 0) return;
```

**After**: Proper computation from state

```typescript
// ✅ FIXED
const selectedPages = pdfPages.filter((page) => page.selected);

if (!uploadedFile || selectedPages.length === 0) {
  toast({
    title: "No Pages Selected",
    description: "Please select pages to split before downloading.",
    variant: "destructive",
  });
  return;
}
```

### **3. Enhanced User Feedback**

Both tools now provide proper feedback:

- **Better validation**: Clear error messages when no pages selected
- **Improved filenames**: Include page count in filename
- **Consistent logging**: Same console output format as compress
- **Same UX flow**: Match the compress tool exactly
