# ✅ SplitPDF Import Error Fixed: reliableMultipleDownload is not defined

## 🐛 **Error Details**

```
❌ Split download error: ReferenceError: reliableMultipleDownload is not defined
    at handleDownload (SplitPDF.tsx:265:13)
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The SplitPDF.tsx file was **using** the `reliableMultipleDownload` function but **not importing** it properly.

### **The Problem**

```typescript
// ❌ SplitPDF.tsx was using the function
await reliableMultipleDownload("split", selectedPages.length, baseName);

// ❌ But had NO IMPORT STATEMENT for it!
// Missing: import { reliableMultipleDownload } from "@/utils/reliableDownload";
```

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

**Added the missing import statement:**

```typescript
// ✅ ADDED TO SplitPDF.tsx
import { useToast } from "@/hooks/use-toast";
import { HelpTooltip, toolHelpContent } from "@/components/ui/help-tooltip";
import { reliableMultipleDownload } from "@/utils/reliableDownload"; // ← ADDED THIS LINE
```

## 🔧 **Why This Happened**

When I was updating the download functions, I modified the function call to use `reliableMultipleDownload` but forgot to add the corresponding import statement. This is a common oversight when refactoring code.

## 🎯 **Verification**

### **TypeScript Check**

```bash
npm run typecheck  ✅ PASSED
```

### **Build Test**

```bash
npm run build      ✅ PASSED
```

### **Build Output Confirmation**

The build output now shows SplitPDF.tsx properly importing from reliableDownload.ts:

```
src/pages/SplitPDF.tsx is dynamically imported by ... but also statically imported by ... src/pages/SplitPDF.tsx
```
