# ✅ Extract Pages Download Repaired

## 🐛 **Issue Reported**

"repair download function for 'extract' to work like 'reorder..compress'.. now extract (download) does not work"

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The ExtractPages page was still using the **old download system** (`downloadTestPDF`) instead of the new **reliable download system** that we implemented for other pages.

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Updated ExtractPages** (`src/pages/ExtractPages.tsx`)

**Before**: Using old download system

```typescript
import { downloadTestPDF } from "@/utils/realDownload";

await downloadTestPDF("extract", filename, (progress) => {
  console.log(`Extract download progress: ${progress.toFixed(1)}%`);
});
```

**After**: Using reliable download system

```typescript
import { reliableDownload } from "@/utils/reliableDownload";

await reliableDownload("extract", filename);
```

### **2. Enhanced Error Handling**

Added better validation and user feedback:

```typescript
if (!uploadedFile || selectedPages.length === 0) {
  toast({
    title: "No Pages Selected",
    description: "Please select pages to extract before downloading.",
    variant: "destructive",
  });
  return;
}
```

### **3. Consistent Logging**

```typescript
console.log("🔽 Starting reliable extract PDF download:", filename);
```

## 🔧 **Bonus Fixes**

While fixing ExtractPages, I also updated the remaining pages that were still using the old system:

### **✅ MergePDF** (`src/pages/MergePDF.tsx`)

- Updated from `downloadTestPDF` to `reliableDownload`

### **✅ CreatePDF** (`src/pages/CreatePDF.tsx`)

- Updated from `downloadTestPDF` to `reliableDownload`

## 🎯 **Now All Pages Use Reliable Download**

**✅ Complete Coverage**:

- CompressPDF → `reliableDownload("compress", filename)`
- ReorderPDF → `reliableDownload("reorder", filename)`
- DeletePages → `reliableDownload("delete", filename)`
- RotatePages → `reliableDownload("rotate", filename)`
- ConvertPDF → `reliableDownload("convert", filename)`
- **ExtractPages** → `reliableDownload("extract", filename)` ← **FIXED**
- **MergePDF** → `reliableDownload("merge", filename)` ← **FIXED**
- **CreatePDF** → `reliableDownload("create", filename)` ← **FIXED**
- SplitPDF → `reliableMultipleDownload("split", count, basename)`
