# ✅ Duplicate Import Error Fixed

## 🐛 **Error Details**

```
SyntaxError: Identifier 'DocumentEditor' has already been declared
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The error occurred because there were **duplicate import statements** for the `DocumentEditor` component in the `CreatePDF.tsx` file.

## 📍 **Location of Issue**

**File**: `src/pages/CreatePDF.tsx`

**Problem**: Duplicate imports on lines 5 and 8

```typescript
// Line 5
import { DocumentEditor } from "@/components/document-editor";
import { toast } from "sonner";
import { useToast } from "@/hooks/use-toast";
// Line 8 - DUPLICATE!
import { DocumentEditor } from "@/components/document-editor";
import { reliableDownload } from "@/utils/reliableDownload";
```

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

**Removed the duplicate import**:

```typescript
// AFTER - Clean imports
import { DocumentEditor } from "@/components/document-editor";
import { toast } from "sonner";
import { useToast } from "@/hooks/use-toast";
import { reliableDownload } from "@/utils/reliableDownload";
```

## 🔧 **How This Happened**

This duplicate import was introduced when we added the `reliableDownload` import to the CreatePDF page. The import was accidentally added without removing or checking for existing imports.

## 🎯 **Verification**

```bash
npm run typecheck  ✅ PASSED
```

### **Build Test**
